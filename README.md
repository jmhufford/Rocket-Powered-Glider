# Rocket-Powered-Glider

This is the final version of the code developed for the rocket powered glider senior design project at UCF.
The project flew running this code and ended up winning out against 5 other teams attempting the same project. 
Due to the large amount of yaw drift and lack of time the heading controller was never fully integrated.
Roll and pitch control worked beautifully and can be seen in action here:

A manual override was also incorporated as a safety feature.
